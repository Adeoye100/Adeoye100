👋 Hello, I’m Adeoye Opeyemi, also known as **Adeoye100**,
   I focus on web design and smart software that solves problems and meets the tastes of my audience.

  I'm learning daily, growing in tech, and building my path as a software engineer.
  I enjoy the pain of fixing bugs, building projects from scratch or existing ones, and tackling real challenges with code.
